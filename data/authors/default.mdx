I'm Bidit Giri, a passionate undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence. My primary focus lies in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models (LLMs) — exploring how machines can learn to understand and generate human-like language.

I enjoy dissecting model architectures, building intelligent systems, and fine-tuning LLMs for real-world tasks. Whether it's developing chatbots, generating text, or training models on custom data, I'm constantly experimenting and learning at the frontier of AI.

Reflections through blogs on AI, language models, and emerging tools

As I continue deepening my expertise, I’m excited to collaborate, learn, and contribute to the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence.
